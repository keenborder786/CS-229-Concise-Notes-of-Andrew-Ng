## What is this?
<p1> I hand created these notes from video lectures of CS-229. These are concise,clear and easy to understand notes. The purpose of these notes is to help the Machine Learning Community. The notes have been made in a clear and direct way, while covering all of the fundamental concepts of Machine Learning in a very summarized way.All of the actual content belongs to <a href='http://cs229.stanford.edu/'>CS 229 Class</a>, I just tried to made their content more concise so that anyone looking to refresh their knowledge or revise fundamental concepts, can refer my notes.</p1>
